How to find divergence:
1. Find first low that has an rsi sub 30.

2. Keep track of subsequent lower prices with higher rsi.

3. If a lower price is found with a lower rsi than previous price,
   remove previous price from list.  Repeat until previous price
   has a lower rsi.

4. Can use the length of this array to quantify strength of divergence
   and quality of signal.

5. In determining the quality of the signal, must keep in mind the
   differences between each higher rsi and lower price.

Object Oriented Approach:
1.  A class called asset.
2.  An object of this class should: 
        Be a specific pair.
        Keep track of its rsi divergence on multiple time frames.
        Alert when divergence is detected.


Algorithm that determines the quality of the signal/divergence:
1. Quality formula should account for:
    Depth or height of first RSI high/low (depth below 30 or hieght above 70 == better signal).
    Percent difference in subsequent price and rsi lows (greater percent == better signal).
    Number of subsequent lows (more lows == better signal).
